# Completed Coursework

Below are are the highlights of the coursework I have completed pertaining to Object-Oriented Programming, Database Design & Management, and Systems Design & Analysis. You can navigate the assignments with the table of contents above.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in C#: Building Robust and Maintainable Software Solutions

This program serves as a simplified product management system, where products are represented as objects with attributes such as supplier name, product name, ID, type, price, and stock status. Through the use of a custom Product class, the program demonstrates encapsulation by encapsulating data within private fields and providing public properties for controlled access. Additionally, it showcases constructor usage to initialize object instances with provided data, enabling the creation of multiple product objects. The DisplayProducts method iterates through the array of products and utilizes the overridden ToString() method to present product details in a user-friendly format. This project exemplifies fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, data modeling, and implementation in C#.

## Database Design & Management

### Advanced SQL Proficiency: Query Optimization and Complex Data Retrieval

In this SQL assignment, the tasks involved constructing complex queries to retrieve specific data from relational databases. The queries encompassed various operations such as joins, subqueries, set operations, and logical operators to extract information meeting specific criteria. By carefully examining table contents and applying appropriate SQL syntax, proficiency in retrieving information related to property management, service requests, and owner details was demonstrated. These exercises showcased advanced SQL skills, including the use of operators like IN, EXISTS, ANY, ALL, and set operations such as UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT, highlighting a comprehensive grasp of SQL query optimization and data retrieval strategies.

### SQL Mastery: Database Management and Optimization

This assignment involves creating and modifying a table called LARGE_PROPERTY, initially without primary keys, then altering it to include a new column for square footage. Data was inserted into this table based on specified criteria, and subsequent updates were made to adjust monthly rents. Conditional updates were applied to decrease rents for properties exceeding a certain threshold, and specific rows were inserted, updated, and deleted as per provided instructions. Additionally, stored procedures were created to display property owner information and update owner last names, utilizing parameters for flexibility.

## Systems Analysis & Design

### Dunk Data: Collaborative Project Specification for UofL Men's Basketball Team

This collaborative project focused on designing a website and database to manage basketball player information for the University of Louisville Men's Basketball Team. The project encompassed various stages including defining system requirements, creating use case descriptions, diagrams, and sequence diagrams, developing a trace matrix, designing class and database diagrams, outlining user interface navigation and screen layouts, crafting data capture forms, planning data presentation, constructing a Gantt chart, detailing physical architecture design, addressing security concerns and non-functional requirements, and building elaboration phase prototypes.
