<p>
I completed a cloud security support engineer internship in the Summer of 2023 with Providence St. Joseph Health based in Renton, Washington. 
I had the opportunity to immerse myself in healthcare cybersecurity by working with Azure cloud security solutions and gaining hands-on 
experience with Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra-ID). I was able to gain a better understanding of how cloud 
SOC teams operate, detection and monitoring techniques in the cloud, and how healthcare security auditing and governance works. 
You can find more details of this position in my resume.
